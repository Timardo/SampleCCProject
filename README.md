# SampleCCProject

This is sample project for [ContentCreator](https://github.com/Timardo/ContentCreator) mod. It uses ForgeGradle system for obfuscating

This project covers all the features ContentCreator provides, currently these:

 - Registering event classes
 - Registering commands
 
This addon adds 3 commands, one which will just set the weather to rainy, other 2 are from awesome mod GulliverReborn, it also covers all of its features. Check the repository [here](https://github.com/CammiePone/Gulliver-Reborn).
 
Even though the sample functionality provided in this project is a bit beyond the scope of ContentCreator, you can at least see its power and simplicity. Most of small utility mods reacting to events that occur periodically could be transformed into an addon.

Actual scope of this mod and tutorial how to set up an addon dev environment can be found on the [ContentCreator](https://github.com/Timardo/ContentCreator)'s GitHub page
